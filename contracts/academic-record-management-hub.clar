;; AcademicRecordManagementHub - Comprehensive student achievement tracking system with hierarchical permissions
;;
;; This framework provides a robust infrastructure for academic record creation, authentication, and access management
;; featuring detailed logging mechanisms and flexible authorization frameworks

;; ===== Administrative Control Constants =====

;; Master administrator wallet address for system governance
(define-constant system-administrator-wallet tx-sender)

;; ===== System Response Codes =====

;; Response code for insufficient access permissions during record operations
(define-constant access-denied-insufficient-rights-error (err u305))

;; Response code when attempting to view records without proper clearance
(define-constant record-access-forbidden-error (err u307))

;; Response code for record classification validation failures
(define-constant record-category-validation-error (err u308))

;; Response code when system administrator privileges are required but not present
(define-constant administrator-authorization-required-error (err u300))

;; Response code when requested academic record does not exist in registry
(define-constant academic-record-missing-error (err u301))

;; Response code when attempting to register an already existing academic record
(define-constant duplicate-record-registration-error (err u302))

;; Response code for invalid record identifier string format violations
(define-constant record-identifier-syntax-error (err u303))

;; Response code when record performance metrics fall outside acceptable ranges
(define-constant performance-metrics-boundary-error (err u304))

;; Response code for unauthorized record access attempts by non-permitted entities
(define-constant unauthorized-record-access-attempt-error (err u306))

;; ===== State Management Variables =====

;; Sequential counter for maintaining unique academic record identifiers throughout the system
(define-data-var academic-record-counter-state uint u0)

;; ===== Helper Function Implementations =====

;; Performs comprehensive validation of record category string format and length constraints
;; 
;; Parameters:
;;   category-text: ASCII string representing the academic record category (max 32 characters)
;;
;; Returns:
;;   Boolean value indicating whether the category format meets system requirements
;;
;; Validation Rules:
;;   - Category string must contain at least one character (non-empty)
;;   - Category string length must not exceed 32 characters for database compatibility
(define-private (validate-category-format-requirements 
    (category-text (string-ascii 32)))

    (> (len category-text) u0)
